# Report for this Assessment

## Challenges:
	- Data Validation: Implementing robust data validation and handling validation errors efficiently was a challenge. I had to ensure that incoming data from requests adheres to the specified rules and constraints.
	- Database Interactions: Managing database interactions and handling database errors required careful attention. Optimizing database queries and transactions were crucial for maintaining the application's performance.
	- Error Handling: Designing a comprehensive error handling mechanism to provide meaningful error messages to clients and logging errors for debugging purposes was a challenging aspect.

## Points for Improvement:
	- Test Coverage: Due to time constraints, I couldn't achieve full test coverage. To improve it, I would write more unit tests and integration tests to ensure the robustness and reliability of the application.
	- Code Refactoring: There are parts of the codebase that could be refactored for better code organization, readability, and maintainability.

## Self Evaluation:
	- 8 of 10

## Missing Items:
	- While the initial codebase and project requirements were clear, there were a few minor design aspects that could have been more explicitly defined, such as handling specific error scenarios and input validation rules. Additional clarification on these aspects would have been helpful.

## Time:
	- I spent approximately 2 hours to finish this assignment. The time includes understanding the requirements, designing the solution, coding, testing, and documentation.
